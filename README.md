# Cortex-M-gcc-devcontainer

Devcontainer for assembler on a Cortex M MCU based on [Martin Hubacek example](https://www.martinhubacek.cz/blog/arm-cortex-bare-metal-gcc-assembly-tutorial/).

This examples is tested on a Nuvoton M031 but it will work on other Cortex MCUs. In the Makefile, change the `-Ttext 0x0000000` option depending on your MCU.


## Compilation

To compile run `make`.

## Debugging with Nulink

Nuvoton requires a modified version of openOCD which is running on a windows machine. The `.bat` file containes the default path to run Nuvoton's openocd in its default path. 


Once openocd is running on your windows host machine, you can connect your devcontainer using `make debug`

## Debugging with J-Link

J-Link can be used by openocd, but it also comes with an optimized gdb. To use J-Link, directly start the `JLinkGDBServerCL.exe` with the appropriate flags, which will open a gdb server listening to port `2331`. You can use the .bat file in the repo, if the version matches. 

Connect to the gdb client with `make debug` or `gdb-multiarch ./main.elf` and then connect to the JLinkGDBServer using `target extended-remote host.docker.internal:2331`.

Once connected, you can flash the program via `load main.elf` and restart the debugging session with `monitor reset halt`.

### Detailed operation

Once openocd is running on your windows host machine, you can connect your devcontainer gdb-multiarch in this way

```
gdb-multiarch ./main.elf
```
and you'll get something like

To access openocd on your windows machine, you need to send the command
```
target extended-remote host.docker.internal:3333
```
and you'll be inside gdb
